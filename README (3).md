# Predictive Maintenance using IBM SPSS Modeler

## Project Type
Academic Project – Predictive Analytics

## Tools Used
- IBM SPSS Modeler
- Data Visualization (Graphs & Tables)
- CHAID Classification

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a Predictive Maintenance Model using IBM SPSS Modeler.
The dataset represents operational data of industrial machines working on a rotational principle.
The goal is to predict machine conditions and identify failures in advance to support condition-based maintenance.

## Objective
- Identify perfectly operating machines
- Detect machines with operational issues
- Extract machines prone to power failure
- Support maintenance decisions using predictive analytics

## Model Workflow
1. Data Import & Understanding
2. Machine Classification based on torque ranges
3. Issue percentage prediction using CHAID node
4. Perfect machine data extraction
5. Failure and power failure data extraction

## Key Insights
- Optimal torque range: 12–65
- Torque values below or above this range indicate failures
- Predictive analytics enables early failure detection

## Outcome
The model supports proactive maintenance decisions, reducing downtime and improving efficiency.

## Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with IBM SPSS Modeler
- Predictive analytics workflow understanding
- Data preprocessing and classification
